### "DE_results.xlsx" contains resulst from differential expression analyses for "CPC", "Shockable", "Randomization code", "dead at 72 h" and "dead at followup" variables.

### row_annotations.rds: annotations for gene ids
### row_annotations_with_prteinID.rds nnotations for gene ids containing uniprot protein IDs

### DE_results_annotated.xlsx		contains resulst from differential expression analyses for "CPC", "Shockable", "Randomization code", "dead at 72 h" and "dead at followup" variables. These results are the same as in "DE_results.xlsx" but are annoted fro gene and protein IDs to be able to compare with proteomics data.


## Figures conatins figures from PCA, correlation of PCs with clinical variables and volcano plots

 
## Results.rds contains resulst from differential expression analyses for "CPC", "Shockable", "Randomization code", "dead at 72 h" and "dead at followup" variables. This is an object to easily handle results in R programming language
